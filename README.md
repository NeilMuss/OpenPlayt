# OpenPlayt

A small, open hardware format for digital music and mixed media.  
Artists create a **Playt** by loading an SD card, placing it in a simple cartridge, and adding their own artwork.  
Listeners slide it into any compatible player and step into the world the artist put inside.

OpenPlayt is physical, durable, and entirely offline.

## What is OpenPlayt?

OpenPlayt is a platform built around three pieces:

### 1. The Playt (Cartridge)
A tiny physical release that holds:
- A standard SD card  
- A spring-protected contact tongue  
- Album art or notes printed on the face  

Simple enough to make at home or on the road.

### 2. The Player
A device anyone can build or customize.  
It reads the SD card, plays audio, and can show images, video, or small interactive pieces.

### 3. The Open Standards
Shared conventions that keep every Playt compatible with every player.  
Hardware files, firmware, and software tools are all open.

## Why This Exists

Streaming is convenient, but it leaves little room for connection.  
OpenPlayt gives artists a format they control and listeners something they can hold.  
No accounts. No servers. No tracking. Just art meeting its audience directly.
