# Playt Design Principles

Playt is a physical–digital music format created to revive the intentionality and joy of owning music.  
These principles guide the design of every part of the system—from the object in your hand to the software that plays it.

---

## 1. **Simplicity First**
A Playt must be easy to understand, easy to create, and easy to use.  
Physical and digital affordances should be obvious without instructions.  
Nothing should require technical expertise beyond basic folder creation and file copying.

---

## 2. **Delight Through Physicality**
A Playt is an object meant to be held, displayed, traded, gifted, and collected.  
Material choices, dimensions, and labeling support a tactile, intentional experience.  
The digital layer should complement—not replace—the feeling of owning something.

---

## 3. **Open, Durable, and Archivable**
The format must be:
- Documented publicly  
- Editable with ordinary tools  
- Backward- and forward-compatible  
- Playable without proprietary software whenever possible  

A Playt should still make sense in 20–50 years.

---

## 4. **Music-Centered**
The core of every Playt is the album, EP, single, or mix.  
All additional layers (commentary, visuals, etc.) are optional and must never obscure the listening experience.

---

## 5. **Respect for the Artist’s Intent**
Playt should support:
- Album sequencing  
- Track transitions  
- Album art  
- Liner notes  
- Optional commentary, slideshows, and more  

But the default experience must honor the creator’s intended order, flow, and mood.

---

## 6. **Honest Limitations**
Playt intentionally restricts certain features (e.g., default no shuffle) to preserve ritual and focus.  
Limitations reinforce the experience, not hinder it.

---

## 7. **Extensible Without Breaking**
Optional layers (interactive art, video, processing sketches, etc.) must:
- Never break the core album playback  
- Use fixed folder names or declarations in the header file  
- Fall back gracefully on players that don’t support them  

A Playt that contains optional layers should still be fully valid when those layers are ignored.

---

## 8. **Transparency and Trust**
Files on a Playt should be human-readable whenever possible:
- JSON headers  
- Standard audio formats  
- Plain folders for layers  
- Clear structure  

Users should understand what is happening, not rely on magic.

---

## 9. **Creator Sovereignty**
Artists and listeners should be able to:
- Create Playts offline  
- Distribute them physical-only, digital-only, or hybrid  
- Avoid platforms entirely if desired  

Ownership is literal, not metaphorical.

---

## 10. **Sustainable Constraints**
The system should encourage:
- Focused releases  
- Thoughtful mixes  
- Cohesive albums  
- Meaningful extras  

Playt should not devolve into a dumping ground for limitless files.  
The format guides creators toward intention.
