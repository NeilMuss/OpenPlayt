# OpenPlayt Concept Document

## 1. Purpose

OpenPlayt is a physical format for digital music and mixed media.
It gives artists a simple way to release work on a small, durable cartridge and gives listeners a direct, offline experience that doesn’t depend on streaming services or centralized platforms.

At its core, OpenPlayt is a meeting place between artist and listener that remains under their control.

## 2. Why Physical Digital Media

Streaming made music easy to access, but it flattened the experience.
OpenPlayt restores a sense of presence. When someone holds a Playt, they’re holding a piece of the artist’s intent: a container with music, images, video, and even interactive elements if the artist chooses to include them.

This is not nostalgia. It’s a way to make digital work feel grounded again.

## 3. What a Playt Is

A Playt is a small cartridge containing:
- A standard SD card with album content
- A spring-protected tongue that exposes the contacts only when inserted
- A printable faceplate for art, notes, or anything the musician wants to share

The design keeps manufacturing simple enough for independent creators to handle on their own, with basic tools and inexpensive materials.

## 4. The Player

The player completes the interaction. It can be:
- A DIY build using open schematics
- A simple reference model
- A customized design created by a band or a collaborator

Players can vary in style and form, but they all follow shared conventions so any Playt works in any compatible device.

The player isn’t hidden or neutral. It’s part of the creative field.

## 5. Artist Experience

A musician can build a Playt in minutes:
1. Load files onto an SD card
2. Insert it into a blank cartridge
3. Print and attach a label

No accounts, uploads, or middle layers.
A release can happen at a kitchen table or a tour van just as easily as a studio.

Artists keep full ownership of their work. Every cartridge includes a LICENSE.txt chosen by the artist: Creative Commons, All Rights Reserved, or anything they prefer.

## 6. Listener Experience

A listener inserts the Playt and steps into what the artist made.
The device handles audio, images, video, and small interactive pieces built with simple tools (Processing, lightweight engines, or custom scripts).

It all works offline.
Nothing tracks, syncs, phones home, or expires.

This makes each Playt a stable, lasting object.

## 7. Openness

OpenPlayt is built on three forms of openness:
- Hardware: Licensed under CERN OHL-S so improvements remain shareable.
- Software: MIT-licensed so artists have full freedom to modify, extend, or embed.
- Content: Chosen by the artist, not the platform.

The aim is a long-lived ecosystem that welcomes custom players, homemade cartridges, forks, experiments, and entirely new directions.

## 8. Vision

OpenPlayt is not trying to compete with streaming.
It’s carving out a small, sturdy space where music and art feel personal again.
A format that belongs to the people who make and enjoy it.

A Playt can be traded, gifted, collected, shown, or lived with.
The technology stays simple. The feeling stays human.

## 9. Roadmap (Early Draft)
- First release of the cartridge mechanical design
- Reference PCB for the player
- Basic firmware for reading Playts and launching content
- Example interactive album for testing
- Toolkit for artists: template folder structure, preview player, label layout
- Community guidelines for custom player design
