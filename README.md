# OpenPlayt
OpenPlayt is an open hardware and software platform for physical digital music. The "Playt" cartridge is only one piece: a durable object that bands sell, share, or trade. Each plate can carry music, photos, videos, and interactive content, all delivered through open conventions. The goal is a flexible community-owned format for album experiences.
