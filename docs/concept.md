# The Problem With Streaming Music

We are in the age of streaming. Huge companies feed us songs using predictive algorithms.

Streaming has ruined the music experience for the sake of convenience. Bands don't get paid. Albums don't get played. It has gotten so bad that we don't even know if the music was auto-generated.

They talk about interest in vinyl and casettes as 'nostalgia', but maybe it's more than that. Maybe something real is missing.

We need something new, not something old. We need to take the best parts of old-school media: the art, the connection, the sharing, and the album as a work of art, and add new types of experiences with a durable, portable form. 

# A Platform for Artists

OpenPlayt is a new digital physical medium without limitations.

It allows artists to craft an album experience using open source hardware and software. Digital files are saved onto a cartridge housing an SD card. The cartridge is inserted into a player that can run its content, which could just be songs, or it could be much more.
